# machinit

Provides a simple way of syncing files between different machines using git.

Currently, only supports Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04, but that should hit the majority of the users.

You can run machinit currently by running 'sudo node machinit.js help' to get a list of possible commands and options.
You can also install machinit globally via npm by running 'sudo npm install -g .' from within the repository directory after cloning it.
