# machinit

Provides a simple way of syncing files between different machines using git.

Currently, only supports Ubuntu 14.04, with almost no support for Ubuntu 16.04 (coming, just not yet).

You can run machinit currently by running 'sudo node machinit.js help' to get a list of possible commands and options.
